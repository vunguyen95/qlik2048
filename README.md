# 2048-Game-VU-NGUYEN

This repository is reserved only for the assessment interview of Qlik and self-learning. It is a web-based implementation of the classic _2048 game_, built with React. It features a clean interface, smooth animation and several other features.
The game is deployed on Netlify (from this repository). Click here [link-to-deployment](https://vuqlik-2048.netlify.app/)

## Included features

- Classic 2048 Gameplay: 4x4 grid Æ°here you slide and merge tiles.

  - Move tiles when player presses arrow keys (prevent scrolling)
  - Generate new tiles for every turn
  - Merge two colliding tiles into one
  - Depending on the values, a tile has different color (up to 2048)

- Win/Loss condition:
  - Win: If the player reaches the 2048 tile, a message is displayed with an option to continue to achieve a higher score or to start a new game.
  - Loss: When the board is full _and_ no more moves are possible
- Score and Best Score: Tracking your current Score and Best Score (saved to `localStorage`)
- Animations/Transitions: Tiles slide and merge smoothly across the board. Merge tiles have "pop" animation, new tiles fade in nicely.
- Touch/mobile support - swipe to move the tiles (prevent scrolling)
- Sound effects: (Optional) sounds for tiles sliding and merging.

- Game Controls:
  - Pause/Resume: Pause the game at anytime
  - Mute/Unmute: Toggle sound effects on or off
  - Restart: Start a new game at any point
  - Dark Mode: A dark theme for comfortable playing in low-light conditions.
